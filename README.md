## how dose it work 
this script will catch the first unit and check if its even or odd  
```python
x = x[-1]
#catch the first unit of the number
if x%2 == 0 :
            return "even"
        elif x%2 == 1 :
            return "odd"

#check if its even or odd
```
dont forget to check [here](https://github.com/amirsamgoharpay/even-or-odd/blob/main/htuam.py) for using the script as module
